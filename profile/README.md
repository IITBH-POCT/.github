- Software: AI algorithms for RBC shape detection  
- Server: Secure data storage and result management

## P2: SCD Analysis using Blood Turbidity  
A turbidity-based diagnostic system that analyzes light scattering in blood to detect SCD.  
**Components:**  
- Optical chamber with controlled lighting  
- Monochrome or IR camera for precise imaging  
- Microcontroller for data capture and processing

## P3: Analysis Probe Detection  
A probe monitoring unit ensuring calibration accuracy and reliability for diagnostic devices.  
**Components:**  
- Probe with integrated sensors  
- Embedded controller for real-time monitoring
